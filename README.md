# Updated-portfolio
When you open up the website portfolio you are then presented by the Home screen with background and options on the top right side of the game.
When you scroll down you will see the page shift/scroll smooth to About and Services
You can also click the 3 options at the top right of the page and it will take you directly to whichever option you chose.
Down on the bottom in speciality i have hover buttons on the 3 statements on the bottom, I tried getting those to redirect you to another html but i need more practice on that
and could not figure it out.
